## An Adaptive Order Execution Strategy for VWAP tracking
This folder contains related materials of an adaptive execution strategy for high
frequency trading in SET (Stock Exchange of Thailand). The objective of the strategy is to buy or sell stocks for a specific amount in SET to match the actual daily market
VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) as much as possible in a specified time interval for daytrading. By sending required amounts of stocks to acquire or liquidate in a specific time interval, our adaptive execution algorithm will calculate a volume profile and a ratio between Limit Order
(LO) and Market Order (MO) and send the order at each time step until the end of the time interval. The algorithm can be tested in
an order simulation system by using a historical data set from Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).
